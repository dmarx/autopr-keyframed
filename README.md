# Keyframed

Keyframed is a python library that provides a set of datatypes for specifying and\n It is designed to be easy to use and integrate into existing projects.\n \n ## Installation\n \n+## Tutorial\n+\n+The Keyframed library provides a set of datatypes for specifying and manipulating curves parameterized by keyframes and interpolators. This tutorial outlines the planned features and functionality of the library.\n+\n+### Purpose\n+\n+The Keyframed library is designed to make it easy to work with keyframe-based animations and curves in Python. Whether you're working on a game, a visualization tool, or any other project that involves animation, Keyframed provides the datatypes you need to get the job done.\n+\n+### Datatypes\n+\n+Keyframed provides several datatypes for working with curves and keyframes. These include:\n+\n+- `Curve`: A collection of keyframes and an interpolator that defines a curve.\n+- `Keyframe`: A point on a curve that defines a value at a specific time.\n+- `Interpolator`: A function that defines how values between keyframes are interpolated.\n+\n+### Interpolators\n+\n+Keyframed provides several built-in interpolators, including:\n+\n+- `Linear`: Linear interpolation between keyframes.\n+- `Cubic`: Cubic interpolation between keyframes.\n+\n ## Contributing\n \n If you want to contribute to Keyframed, you can do so in the following ways:
