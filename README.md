# üõ† Usage

Warning: This Github Action is currently **in development**, and in **alpha release**.
If you're interested in using this action, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vz7p9TfHsh).

## Using your own OpenAI token

If you don't have access to GPT-4, you can use `text-davinci-003` or `chatgpt-3.5-turbo`; just override the `model` and `context_limit` input variables.

You may press "Use this template" to create a new repository with the AutoPR workflow file, or copy it to your own repository manually.

You will also need to perform the following steps:
- In `Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions`, enter your Open AI API key as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- In `Settings -> Actions -> General`, scroll down to `Workflow permissions` and enable `Allow Github Actions to create and approve pull requests`

Whenever a new issue is opened or edited, the action will push a branch named `autopr/issue-#` and open a pull request to the base branch.
Please note that if the branch already exists (on issue edit), it will be overwritten.

If you'd like to try out GPT-4 AutoPR, you can make an issue in this repository, and I'll run it manually.
